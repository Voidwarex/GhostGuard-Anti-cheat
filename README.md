GhostGuard Anti-Cheat is a new method of locking down the pc and only allowing certain applications through. To prevent app spoofing we implemented techniques like sha256 checking and fully making the cheat server sided. This is an old version as we did move to our 
own GG API which made it more secure how ever this still works just fine.
